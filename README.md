Nestled in the serene foothills of the Himalayas, Haridwar is a city deeply rooted in Indian mythology and spiritual tradition. Known as the "Gateway to the Gods," it has been a sacred pilgrimage destination for centuries. Haridwar, mentioned in ancient texts, is where the holy Ganges River enters the plains from its Himalayan origin. It has witnessed countless devotees seeking salvation and spiritual renewal.
Gangotri Dham, located in the Uttarkashi district, is one of the Char Dhams in Uttarakhand, holding a prominent place in Hindu religion. Gangotri is believed to be the source of the Ganga River, with its mythological origins linked to King Bhagirath's penance to bring the river to earth. The revered Gangotri temple, built in the 18th century by Amar Singh Thapa, stands as a testament to devotion and faith.
For those short on time but eager to experience spiritual solace, the Ek (1) Dham Yatra Tour Package 2024 - 3 Days/2 Nights offers a meticulously planned itinerary, starting from Haridwar and culminating at Gangotri.
